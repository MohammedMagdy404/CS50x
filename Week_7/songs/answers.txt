If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:
    by calculate the average of energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. 
    making the energy represent a color degree, valence, and danceability represent the opasity and the speed of the aura motion.


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    i think we must be analyze the different moods of the person among the year making a clusters and use more accurate math relations.
